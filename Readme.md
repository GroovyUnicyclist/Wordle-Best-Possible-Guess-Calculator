This is a program I wrote to figure out what words would cover the 5 most common letters based on the possible answers and possible guesses in wordle.
# Files Included
- answers.txt: all the possible wordle answers
- guesses.txt: all the possible wordle guesses, includes more words than the answers files
- letterfrequencies.csv: the frequencies of letter occurances in all the possible answers
- letterfrequencydata.xlsx: an excel file with a letter frequency graph and a calculator for the score of any 5 letter word
- script.py: the python script which generates all the outputs
- wordscores.csv: the scores for all possible guesses with 5 unique characters, which signifies how useful of a first guess the word is
